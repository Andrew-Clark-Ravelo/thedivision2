## The Lost Chatterbox (P90)

You need 3 parts and one blueprint to craft this. The parts drop from locked boxes you have to open with faction keys. For each part, simply go to the mentioned district, open locked boxes (in the open world or inside missions) with looted keys and eventually you will get it. Once you do, go to another district and open boxes there. Keep in mind drops are random, so you might have to open multiple boxes to get it.

- Creative Mag: Federal Triangle
- Loaded Canister: Downtown East
- Modified Mods: Judiciary Square

Once you have all three parts, do the Bank Headquarters main mission on challenging difficulty. When you get the key from the enemy drop, in that same floor is a hidden panel in the large room before you enter the area with the elevator. It's in the same facing wall as the elevators, at a corner, where you get an interaction prompt. That gives you a key card. Go further and when you enter the vault through the heavy vault door, go left immediately, here you can now open this inner door with your secret keycard. The blueprint can be found inside.

You can now craft this weapon at the crafting station.

## Kendra's Liberty (D50)

During the Capitol Hill stronghold mission, you come across an enemy named "Kendra Nelson". When you kill her she drops a "Pistol: Trigger & Mechanism" exotic material.

To get the rest you have to finish the following missions on hard:

- Sight & Rail: ViewPoint Museum
- Receiver & Paintjob: American History Museum
- Grip & Tags, Blueprint: Space Administration HQ

Once you have all of them, you also need a High-end D50 (The survivalist sidearm will not work). And now you can craft it.
