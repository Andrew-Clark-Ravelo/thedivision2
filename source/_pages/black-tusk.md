## Enemy Types

### Rusher

Unknown

### Assault

Weapon: Assault Rifle

> Ex-special forces, marines, rangers, seals... you name it. These guys come from all sorts of backgrounds, from every hell-hole on the planet. They've seen it all. Done it all. Killed them all. Make sure you're not on their list. - Agent Kelso

* The Black Tusk Assault archetype prefers to fight from behind cover, and move cover-to-cover to avoid enemy fire.

### Sniper

Weapon: Marksman Rifle

> These guys are the best of the best. They use every trick in the book, and on top of that, their taret acquisition is top-notch. If you're reading this, you left yourself exposed too long. - Agent Kelso

* The Black Tusk Sniper archetype takes cover at long rande while attempting to eliminate targets.
* The Sniper sets up decoy lenses that can be confused for their real position. Destroying their lens pouch prevents the Sniper from deploying the countermeasures.
* The sniper deploys a taser drone that seeks out hostiles and stuns them, granting the sniper a clear shot. Destroying the drone on the sniper's back prevents it from being deployed.
