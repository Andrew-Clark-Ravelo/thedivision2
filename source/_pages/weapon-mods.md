Weapon mods can be crafted in the Base of Operations or rewarded through [perks](/perks.html) and [projects](/projects.html). You can get blueprints through side missions, projects and by taking over control points on level 3 or higher. Once you have them, you can use them in as many weapons as you want. Mods fit on guns depending on slots they have, calibers and rail lengths.

The cost of crating the mods scales with your level/world tier. At world tier 4 for example, mods require 680 credits and 26 of each of the two materials it requires.
