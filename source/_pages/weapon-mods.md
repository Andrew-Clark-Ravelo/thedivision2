Weapon mods can be crafted in the Base of Operations or rewarded through [perks](/perks.html) and [projects](/projects.html). Once you have them, you can use them in as many weapons as you want. Each mod has a positive and a negative effect. Mods fit on guns depending on slots they have, calibers and rail lengths.

The cost of crating the mods scales with your level/world tier. At world tier 4 for example, mods require 680 credits and 26 of each of the two materials it requires.

This list is still incomplete, please send screenshots of the mods you may have from the crafting screen that are not yet present here.
