Raids are among the hardest content in the Division 2. You can do them in a group of up to 8 players (two squads of 4). It's been said raids will be added over time and not be available at launch of the game.

## Raid 1: Operation Dark Hours

From different images shown in trailers and on twitter, it seems like the this raid will take place in the Washington National Airport (Ronald Reagan Airport). That location is not on the currently visible [map](/map.html) though, as that airport in reality is far to the south of what is currently visible.

The same images seem to show the Black Tusk faction present, and that the battle appears to happen inside but also outside of the buildings of the airport.
