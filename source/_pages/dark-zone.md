The dark zones are walled off areas where you can encounter other players who may attack you. It's also where dangerous enemies are and high value loot is very common.

To unlock the Dark Zone you need first to find and recruit Senait Ezera to the base of operations. You can then find her in the upper level on the eastern side of the floor.

Once you found something in a dark zone, you need to extract it by bringing it to an extraction zone, shoot a flare and then wait for the helo to arrive. Once it did, you need to attach your loot (maximum 4 loot drops can be attached) and then wait for the loot to be pulled back on board. The loot can be cut down by another player until it's pulled back on board, so guard it carefully.

A player may choose to go rogue (button press, hijacking loot, or hacking) and is then attackable by other players.
