title: Gear
---

Gear is split into these gear slots:

- Mask
- Vest
- Holster
- Backpack
- Gloves
- Kneepads

For each of these slots you can find gear that will give you additional status effects, along side of armor value.

A higher quality item, or higher level, doesn't automatically mean it works better for you. Check the bonuses and values carefully before switching gear.

There are gear mods of various kinds, but little is known about them. It appears though that higher gear has usually more gear mod slots, and that the number of slots can vary on the same piece. If you have more mod slots, you might have less fixed bonuses on a piece of gear. Gear Mods are split into Gear System Mods and Gear Protocol Mods.

## Gear Quality

Gear can present in different qualities. The higher the quality the more attributes the gear might have, including mod slots and talents.

The quality is the same as for [weapons](/weapons.html), from worst to best:

- ? (White)
- Standard (Green)
- Specialized (Blue)
- Superior (Purple)
- High-End (Yellow)


## Gear Talents

Starting at Specialized gear, it can also have talents. Higher quality gear can have multiple talents.

- Hard Hitting: +15% damage to elites
- Spotter: +10% weapon damage to pulsed enemies
- Capacitive: +20% skill duration
- Terminate: Depleting an enemies armor grants +35% skill damage for 15s
- Self Adjusting: +20% armor regeneration

## Gear Brands

Many gear items can also be of a specific brand, which gives you extra bonuses to the existing ones. For each additional gear item of the same brand, you get an additional bonus unlocked (so far, 1 to 3 bonuses). 

So far, these brands have been spotted in the game:

- Providence Defense
- Sokolov Concern
- Richter & Kaiser GmbH
- Wyvern Wear
- Badger Tuff
- Gila Guard
- Airaldi Holdings
- Overlord Armaments
- Alps Summit Armament
