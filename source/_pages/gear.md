title: Gear in The Division 2
meta:
    description: The Division 2 has a huge selection of gear with talents and stats that make your character stronger. Here you find everything you need.
---

Gear is split into these gear slots:

- Mask
- Vest
- Holster
- Backpack
- Gloves
- Kneepads

For each of these slots you can find gear that will give you additional status effects, along side of armor value.

A higher quality item, or higher level, doesn't automatically mean it works better for you. Check the bonuses and values carefully before switching gear.

There are gear mods of various kinds, but little is known about them. It appears though that higher gear has usually more gear mod slots, and that the number of slots can vary on the same piece. If you have more mod slots, you might have less fixed bonuses on a piece of gear. Gear Mods are split into Gear System Mods and Gear Protocol Mods.

## Gear Quality

Gear can present in different qualities. The higher the quality the more attributes the gear might have, including mod slots and talents.

The quality is the same as for [weapons](/weapons.html), from worst to best:

- Worn (White)
- Standard (Green)
- Specialized (Blue)
- Superior (Purple)
- High-End (Yellow)
- Gear Set (Light green)

## Gear Talents
