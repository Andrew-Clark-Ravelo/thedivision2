title: Factions
---

The world is split into multiple factions. Knowing them will heighten your chance to survive in the world of The Division 2.

# Friendly Factions

## The Division

You are part of an elite group of sleeper agents of the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD, or short The Division). Your job is to protect what remains after a catastrophic event when government breaks down.

## JTF

The Joint Task Force is basically everyone that worked in any emergency service when the dollar flu hit the world.

## Civilians

Pretty much everyone else that is not an enemy. They gather in defended settlements and you can see them roaming and scavengening for materials in the city.

# Enemy Factions

## Hyenas

Rowdy group of decentralized pockets. They basically go for the quick and easy kills and are not very organized.

## Outcasts

Not much is known about this faction.

## True Sons

Not much is known about this faction. They appear better armed and organized than the Hyenas.

## Black Tusk

Not much is known about this faction. The Black Tusks show up after you have completed the main storyline of The Division 2 and invade all the main missions, giving you extra challenges to beat them again. They are well organized, armed to the teeth and carry a lot of protection.
