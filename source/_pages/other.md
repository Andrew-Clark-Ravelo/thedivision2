Any tidbit that doesn't fit into another page goes here.

## Bounties

Once you unlock Otis Sykes in the base of operations, you can do daily and weekly bounties. There are [perks](/perks.html) to unlock more bounties and bounties of large difficulty. Year one pass holders will get an extra weekly bounty.

## Currencies

Target Intel (max 50)
:   Information gathered on Bounties across the city

 E-Credits (max 1'000'000'000)
:   Standard JTF currency used to purchase equipment from vendors and for other JTF services.

## Keys

There are keys for the general world and keys for the DZ. They both work the same, as in they allow you to unlock certain special loot boxes. The normal keys are split into factions and can be found in various locations across the map. Look for small boxes mounted against the wall, often in places where you find other loot as well. DZ keys you can get from enemy kills.

## Supplies

You can find components, food and water throughout the [map](/map.html). These are then used to supply settlements or controlpoints to complete projects or boost some perks. There are places where you can find large quantities and where it respawns regularly.

## Trinkets

Random loot items you can find that can be sold for money.

- Stuffed Animal
- Crayon
- Battery
- Tape
- Sewing Kit
- Kid's Jacket
- Kid's shoe
- Kid's sock

- Rope

## Weakpoints

Enemies can have weak points. They usually look like a rad pouch or the likes. Hitting those will give you a yellow indicator and if you hit it often enough the weakpoint will detonate. This can result in an instant kill or other effects, depending on the enemies. 

## Apparel caches

You can get apparel caches in The Division 2, of which there are two types. The standard and event apparel caches.

Standard apparel caches can't be bought and only gotten through gameplay. However the items that drop in those aches individually can be bought in the store. There also can be duplicate items in those apparel caches.

The event apparel caches are different. They are only around for a specific time frame. You can get them the same way as standard ones, except there will never be a duplicate item in them and on top of that, you can buy them with real world currency. Once the event is over, the items that were available in it, become part of the standard apparel caches, so they can be gotten from standard caches or bought individually.

All apparel caches contain only cosmetic items.
