## Patch from 14. March 2019

* Weapons
** We removed a work in progress weapon that was not properly named and balanced.
** Crossbows now deal explosive damage to multiple objects as intended
** Exotic weapons equipped with silencers will now produce the sound they’re intended to make.
** NPCs engaged in combat will now react to grenades as intended.

* Missions
** The ropes will now deploy properly to allow for extraction at the end of the Beekeeper Jeff side mission.
** Players should no longer be able to unlock Castle prematurely. This issue would block progression in some instances.
** In Jefferson Plaza, the NPC scene can no longer be interrupted during a boss fight.
** Fixed a loot exploit that involved repeatedly killing bosses in some Invaded missions.

* PC specific
** PC players playing together while connected to the same network were meeting a number of issues when interacting with each other. This has now been fixed.
** On PC, FreeSync 2 HDR can now properly be selected in game regardless of your PC’s configuration.

* Other
** Stopped "SHD CPU V.2" and "Cyclone Magazine" skill mods from dropping as loot. Player's who already have the items can use them once they unlock the corresponding specialization perk.
** Players will no longer get stuck on black screens after watching introduction cinematics.
** We have updated XP rewards for all end game activities, so that they will scale to the player’s level, instead of being flat values.
** Several corrupted audio issues have been fixed.

## Title update 1.5

* Title Update 1.5 mainly addresses occurrences of audio missing or cutting out experienced by some during Open Beta.
