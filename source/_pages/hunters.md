Hunters are tough enemies that are hidden throughout the world of The Division 2. For each of the hunter locations, there is a ciphertext riddle and then certain actions to complete to make them appear. Hunters reward you with unique masks and ivory keys. The masks will be visible in the base of operations on a wall and of course you can wear them. You need 8 ivory keys to open the ivory box in the lower level of the Base of operations, just a bit east of the inside vendor, in the same area as the barber mirror is hanging, against the eastern wall here.
