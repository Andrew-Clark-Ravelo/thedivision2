title: Crafting

Before you can start to craft, you need to find and recruit Inaya al-Khaliq to the base of operations. You can do so by finishing the Wahsington Hotel Mission and return to Odessa in The Theater. After that you can simply talk to her on the same level that the door with Odessa is, near the western ramp. Then she will be in the crafting room close to where you can upgrade your skills.

Secondly you need blueprints. Those can be gained by completing certain tasks like projects.

When you craft [weapon mods](/weapon-mods.html), they are created and stay with you forever, you can use them in as many guns as you like.

Crafting [weapons](/weapons.html) and [gear](/gear.html) gives you a randomized item of that type you are crafting which can then be deconstructed again to regain some of the material needed for crafting.

A total of 177 blueprints are available. 58 are weapons, 77 are mods and misc, and then 7 each for the 6 gear slots.

You craft items according to your level, so if you are level 7, your weapons and gear will also be level 7.

There is a way to upgrade the workbench for higher tier items, but nothing more is known about that.

## Materials

You have white, green and blue materials.

White: Receiver Components, Protective Fabric

Green: Steel, Ceramics, Polycarbonate

Blue: Carbon Fiber, Electronics, Titanium 

These materials can be found in the world or gained be deconstructing items. There are no fixed locations to gain materials.
