There are currently 3 Specializations available. They start coming into play once you reach level 30 and finish the last mission, little else is known about them.

During year 1 there will be 3 more specializations released.

Each specialization has it's own skill tree you can unlock with points. A total of 160 points are possible to distribute among a specialization. These points are specific per specialization and do not transfer. You can respec those points at any time without cost. Points are awarded by doing certain missions and other activities.

Changing specializations can be done at the quartermaster only. One character can have all specializations.
