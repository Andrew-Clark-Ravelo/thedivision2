## National Archives

Given by Chelsa Watts at the Theater, after reaching level 3 of the Settlement.

Recover important documents from the archives.

South of the navy square control point in federal triangle. It's a pretty straight forward fight through the large entrance room, then the research room until you reach the vault where you can pick up what you are here for. Then you climb up some ropes and find yourself in a round room. Enemies, specially rushers, will come from the front and the sides. The boss is straight ahead and above you, so you are best staying in cover and get rid of all other enemies before tackling that one.
