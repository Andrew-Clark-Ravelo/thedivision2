## Department of Justice

Destroy an important stockpile of True Sons munitions.

Just east of the Safe house in Federal Triangle. After defeating the first set of enemies above, you have to go down into the garage. The next wave there defeated, you have to pick up 4 explosives. 2 are in the garage where you just encountered enemies, the other two you have to go up through the back of the garage to another area. This leads to more enemies, the remaining explosives and through a chain link fence to the initial area again. You need to plant explosives on all four crates, then defeat all enemies to clear this mission. When you plant the explosives, get away from the crate quickly or they hurt or even kill you.

## National Archives

Recover important documents from the archives.

South of the navy square control point in federal triangle. It's a pretty straight forward fight through the large entrance room, then the research room until you reach the vault where you can pick up what you are here for. Then you climb up some ropes and find yourself in a round room. Enemies, specially rushers, will come from the front and the sides. The boss is straight ahead and above you, so you are best staying in cover and get rid of all other enemies before tackling that one.
