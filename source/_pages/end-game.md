## Overview

End game starts when you reach level 30 and complete the last stronghold [mission](/missions.html) at the capitol building. You will be automatically upgraded to World Tier 1 and the [Black Tusk](/black-tusk.html) faction will show up. You will also be able to craft higher end gear and weapons now at the [crafting bench](/crafting.html). At endgame the [specializations](/specializations.html) are becoming available as well.

As soon as the Black Tusk invasion starts, the Theater settlement will be under blockade. Click the settlement on the map and a red line will come out of it. The Grand Washington Hotel is a mission you have to complete first, but also there is a Unknown Activity marker, that will show up. You have to complete that activity for the settlement to be unblocked for you.

## Progression

Besides the [specializations](/specializations.html) progression, you can rank up in world tiers. This is done by completing the 4 stronghold missions (one additional one, Tidal Bassin). To do so, you must first complete 2 linked missions that were invaded by the Black Tusk before attacking the actual stronghold.

Each tier has a required Gear Score to attack a strong hold. It will rise with each completed strong hold. You can find gear and weapons, as well as craft them to up your gear score.

- World Tier 2: 275 Gear Score
- World Tier 3: ? Gear Score
- World Tier 4: ? Gear Score
- World Tier 5: ? Gear Score

These are the strong holds and their linked missions:

- Roosevelt Island: Federal Emergency Bunker and Potomac Event Center
- Capitol Building: Air & Space Museum and Space Administration HQ
- District Union Arena: Grand Washington Hotel and Jefferson Trade Center

Once you cleared all three strongholds, the last stronghold Tidal Bassin will become available to you.
