This page contains info about all locations in the Division 2, that are not already described on other pages. For [Dark Zones](/dark-zone.html), [Missions](/missions.html), [Side Missions](/side-missions.html) and [Collectibles](/collectibles.html) see their respective pages.  

## Districts

Each District is geared towards a certain level bracket. If you try going there before you reach the levels mentioned, you'll not have a good time. It's recommended to tackle them in this order.

- White House (1 - 3): Where the base of operations is located.
- Downtown East (2 - 7): Home to the Theater Settlement.
- Federal Triangle (4 - 8)
- East Mall (7 - 11)
- Southwest (11 - 15)
- Downtown West (15 - 18)
- Constitution Hall (17 - 21)
- West Potomac Park (19 - 23)
- Foggy Bottom (21 - 25)
- West End (23 - 27)
- Roosevelt Island (27 - 30)
- Capitol Hill (30)

There are three [Dark Zones](/dark-zone.html), West, East and South, which have their own leveling for players.

## Settlements

You can fast travel to settlements.

### The Theater

Located in Downtown East. At first you can only enter it through 10th St NW  between E and F St NW.

## Control Points

A control point is held by a faction that controls that area. You first need to eliminate all enemy presence, then survive a counter attack before it's yours. You have to call for civilian help either way, so might as well do it at the beginning, which will help you take the point a little easier. Once it's yours, you can donate ressources to the officer in charge, which can give you some bonuses with specific [perks](/perks.html). You also get access to the supply room that has several good items.

You can use control points as fast travel locations.

- White House
-- Ellipse Fuel Depot
- Downtown East
-- MLK Memorial Library
-- Fallen Cranes
-- Demolition Site
- Federal Triangle
-- Navy Plaza

## Safe houses

Safe houses are safe locations where you have access to sell items and a stash. You have to go to them once to unlock them and they show up as little house icons on your [map](/map.html). You also get icons where to find SHD tech in that area. You can fast travel to safe houses.

- Final Epiphany (Downtown East)
- The 1040 (Federal Triangle)

## Strongholds

Strongholds are the places where the factions are at their strongest. You can go in and take it over to severely weaken that faction.

### Tidal Basin

Final Stronghold, held by the Black Tusk faction. It's impressive and big.
