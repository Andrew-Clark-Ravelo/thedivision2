## Settlements

You can fast travel to settlements.

### The Theater

Located in Downtown East. At first you can only enter it through 10th St NW  between E and F St NW.

## Control Points

A control point is held by a faction that controls that area. You first need to eliminate all enemy presence, then survive a counter attack before it's yours. You have to call for civilian help either way, so might as well do it at the beginning, which will help you take the point a little easier. Once it's yours, you can donate ressources to the officer in charge, which can give you some bonuses with specific [perks](/perks.html). You also get access to the supply room that has several good items.

You can use control points as fast travel locations.
