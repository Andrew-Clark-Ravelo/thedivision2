The map of The Division 2 spans the downtown metro area of Washington DC, from the west of Roosevelt Island to the east of the capitol.

The image below is the map as it appeared in the private beta at the beginning of February 2019. The red outline depicts where players were able to roam.

## Districts

Each District is geared towards a certain level bracket. If you try going there before you reach the levels mentioned, you'll not have a good time. It's recommended to tackle them in this order.

- White House (1 - 3): Where the base of operations is located.
- Downtown East (2 - 7): Home to the Theater Settlement.
- Federal Triangle (4 - 8)
- East Mall (7 - 11)
- Southwest (11 - 15)
- Downtown West (15 - 18)
- Constitution Hall (17 - 21)
- West Potomac Park (19 - 23)
- Foggy Bottom (21 - 25)
- West End (23 - 27)
- Roosevelt Island (27 - 30)
- Capitol Hill (30)

There are three [Dark Zones](/dark-zone.html), West, East and South, which have their own leveling for players.

## Settlements

You can fast travel to settlements.

### The Theater

Located in Downtown East. At first you can only enter it through 10th St NW  between E and F St NW.

## Control Points

A control point is held by a faction that controls that area. You first need to eliminate all enemy presence, then survive a counter attack before it's yours. You have to call for civilian help either way, so might as well do it at the beginning, which will help you take the point a little easier. Once it's yours, you can donate ressources to the officer in charge, which can give you some bonuses with specific [perks](/perks.html). You also get access to the supply room that has several good items.

You can use control points as fast travel locations.

## Safe houses

Safe houses are safe locations where you have access to sell items and a stash. You have to go to them once to unlock them and they show up as little house icons on your [map](/map.html). You also get icons where to find SHD tech in that area. You can fast travel to safe houses.
