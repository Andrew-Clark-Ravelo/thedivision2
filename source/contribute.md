# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in making a contribution to this page.

The source of this page is publicly visible on [Github]({{site.github_link}}). As such you have two ways to contribute.

1. [Open a issue]({{site.github_link~'/issues'}}) on the github repo, where you describe what is wrong or what you want to have improved and someone can then pick that and just do it. You only need a free github account and the ability to write and you can already help!

2. Make large contributions by submitting merge requests. Pretty straight forward if you know your way around git and github, if not, there are great ressources on the github help page. The page uses [Sculpin.io](https://sculpin.io/) to generate pages, so most of the time you get away with just writing simple Markdown files. If you have questions, just submit issues on github.

More help as well as more sites are always welcome.
