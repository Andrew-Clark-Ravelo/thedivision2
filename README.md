This is network site for The Division 2 on the GameStrafe network.

Contributions are always welcome!

## Contributions

Clone the project locally:
`git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gamestrafe/thedivision2.git`

Optionally: You can run a virtual box with all requirements in it, by bringing it up using `vagrant up`

Under windows you will need the NFS plugin, it will prompt you and tell you how to install it. Also don't worry about getting the message file not found when starting, that's normal under windows.

Edit the MD files in source/_pages and that's it. This project uses [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) as a generator if you want to look up some more on that. If you add a page you also have to add a link to it in the place you think works best. All pages are automatically added to the sitemap.

Once you are done with your changes, open a merge request against the repo. Please have some good description on the commits and if you have to test around, squash the commits first.
